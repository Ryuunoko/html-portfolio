<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Sylvester, a boy hailing from East Malaysia with a blend of Taiwanese heritage. 
  Born on August 1st, 1991, I've always had a passion for the performing arts, particularly singing and dancing, alongside indulging in gaming during my leisure time. 
  Sandwiched between two brothers, I embrace the role of the middle child. 
  Recently, I embarked on a wonderful journey as I married my beloved Joscelin, my partner of nearly 12 years.</p>

<p>Professionally, I currently serve as a customer consultant at a construction software company. 
  While I excel in this role, I'm on a quest to unearth my true passion, eagerly exploring avenues where I can leverage my skills and interests. 
  With aspirations of perhaps stepping into the realm of public speaking, I've garnered praise for my oratory abilities, fueling my desire to further develop in this area.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my foremost goal is to shower my wife with the happiness she deserves while leading a life brimming with fulfillment. 
  My journey is one of continuous growth and learning, as I strive to acquire new skills and expand my horizons. 
  Ultimately, my aim is to cultivate a life characterized by happiness, health, and contentment. 
  Join me as I navigate through life's adventures with zest and enthusiasm!</p>
